  - Next step: Kick off secure wipe, then prep clean OS installer

### ⏳ **Pending / Needs Action (High Priority)**

  - Status: Waiting on photo shortlist
  - Next step: Pick 6 starter reference photos (lock vibe), then expand to 12

  - Status: Not yet staged
  - Next step: Drop hero art, embed 1–2 tracks, add share/download CTAs
  
- **NFL — season .ics + marketing stub** ⏱️💵
  - Status: Recurring calendar not created; stub not pinned
  - Next step: Generate basic .ics and paste into a one-page stub
  
- **82–85″ TV — install scheduling** ⏱️🧩
  - Status: Ready to schedule
  - Next step: Choose mount (tilt vs full-motion) after confirming VESA/weight, then block a 2-hr window with 2 people
  
- **TV — warranty & paperwork** ⏱️
  - Status: Likely not registered yet
  - Next step: Register warranty + upload receipt PDF to the asset record

## 🚨 **48-Hour No-Movement Alerts**
- **Gray-to-Green** → Waiting on photo shortlist (stalled since Oct 2)
- **NFL .ics stub** → Still missing initial generation step  
- **PC rebuild** → Hardware ready; no action since Thursday

## 📅 **Calendar-Worthy Reminders**
- **Sunday (Oct 5)**: Aim to publish the first Gray-to-Green mock set
- **Monday (Oct 6)**: Kick off PC OS install & SOP draft
- **Tuesday (Oct 7)**: Begin TV mount & install window

## ⚡ **Quick Wins (<20 min)**
1. Register the TV warranty and upload the receipt
2. Choose 6 Gray-to-Green photos  
3. Start PC secure wipe before breakfast — let it run unattended

## 🎯 **Today's Top 5 Priorities**
1. **Gray-to-Green image set** (⏱️💵) - Pick 6 starter reference photos to lock visual direction
2. **Decommissioned PC — SOP & rebuild** (🧩) - Begin secure wipe process
3. **NFL season .ics + marketing stub** (⏱️💵) - Generate basic .ics with full schedule
4. **82–85″ TV install** (⏱️🧩) - Decide on mount type and schedule 2-hr install block
5. **TV warranty & paperwork** (⏱️) - Register warranty online today

## 🚩 **Risks / Watchlist**
- Design momentum (Gray-to-Green, Jeanie) depends on quick asset picks (photos/hero art)
- TV install needs a scheduled slot + mount decision to avoid drift
- Recurring NFL ops smoother once the .ics + stub exist (reduces weekly overhead)

## 💬 **Motivation**
You've already cleared the runway — today's just about ignition. ✨
