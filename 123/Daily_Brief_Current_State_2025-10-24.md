:CURRENT STATE

- Date: October 24, 2025 (America/Los_Angeles)
- Priority focus: **P1 — n8n self‑hosted deployment on the call‑center Linux server**.
- Daily Brief Builder: **scheduled to generate daily at 06:00 AM PT**, prioritizing P1 items.
- Current projects (per briefs): **n8n Automation Stack (Self‑Hosted)** [P1], **AeroVista Operations Sync** [P2], **Call‑Center Compliance Toolkit** [P2], **Nexus Workflow Library** [P3].
- Supporting artifact: `n8n_costs_overview.txt` uploaded (to inform the cost‑projection subtask).

# Completed

- Added n8n self‑hosted deployment to To‑Do and **set priority to P1 (High)**. *(Oct 6, 2025)*
- Created and enabled **Daily Brief Builder** automation at **06:00 AM PT** with P1‑first ordering. *(Oct 6, 2025)*
- Generated Daily Briefs repeatedly across the period **Oct 6 → Oct 24, 2025**, keeping n8n as the top item.

# In Progress

## P1 — n8n Self‑Hosted Deployment

**Status:** Active — Deployment execution (Cycle 5 ongoing).
**Owner:** —  |  **Target window:** —

**Subtasks (tracking):**

- [ ] Finalize install pack (versions, `.env` structure, secrets layout)
- [ ] Deploy Docker Compose stack (`n8n`, `Postgres`, `Traefik/NGINX`) behind Tailscale
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (Traefik/Let’s Encrypt auto‑renew, enforce redirects)
- [ ] Prefill AeroVista/Nexus seed workflows (webhooks & schedulers)
- [ ] Map free vs enterprise features (limits, licensing impact)
- [ ] Create cost projection for expected executions *(use `n8n_costs_overview.txt` as input)*
- [ ] Set up backups/cron & monitoring (DB dumps, uptime/alerting)
- [ ] Document in SOP (deploy, update, rollback, DR)

## Other Projects

- **AeroVista Operations Sync** — P2 — Ongoing (API/workflow tuning).
- **Call‑Center Compliance Toolkit** — P2 — Design phase (policy/template alignment).
- **Nexus Workflow Library** — P3 — Backlog (import validation pending).

# Planned

- Continue the n8n execution plan today:
  - Finalize install pack → Deploy stack → Enable HTTPS → Import seed workflows → Backups & monitoring → SOP v1 draft.
- (Optional) Add **2:00 PM PT P1 nudge** reminder to reinforce same‑day momentum. *(Awaiting confirmation.)*
- Roll forward Daily Brief Builder to keep P1 first until n8n is deployed and SOP is finalized.
